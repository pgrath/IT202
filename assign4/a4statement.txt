For this project, I used ajax along with JS, php, and mysql to create a basic chat appliation for tewo or more users. Instead of just php, Ajax was used so requests could be made without reloading the page. That way, when a php reuest was made, the user stayed on the same page and could keep talking. Onkeyup was used to update the chat field in the sql db in the background, that way a user didnt have to worry about manually updating it. The recieve field was a simple box that sent another ajax request to pull the messages from the sql db and display them in a box.
