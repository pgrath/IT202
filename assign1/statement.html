Welcome!

<p>
I very much enjoyed working on this project. Web applications are facinating and have the potential to be robust and do so many useful things. The form that linked you here is one such example. This project as fun to work on as it is challenging.</br>
One of the coolest parts about web programming is that it can run on a massive suite of devices; I could go back to a computer from 2005 and the entire project would still work (mostly). I could use a phone and make the site adapt for the screen size.
