Statement: I learned quite a bit during this. I spent a lot of time getting the right formatting for everything, so that the sql update scripts would work properly. I also spent many minutes fixing dumb syntax mistakes I always leave in my php. The grades update form took the most time to finish, as I wanted to try to get much of it done in one line (or as little as possible). I ended up breaking it up into multiple statements, and I think it made it much mroe readable. The registered php update was a bit more simple, as it didn't take much more time. I learned much more about sql, and better ways of formatting my php, and using the percent function to get extra points. Overall, I can safely say I spent many hours on this, but I can't exactly say. I actually enjoyed making this. Thanks for reading.
